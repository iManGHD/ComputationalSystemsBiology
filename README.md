# ComputationalSystemsBiology_Fall2021

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of all the projects, homework assignments, and resources related to the Computational Systems Biology course I completed in my third semester of my Master's degree at Sharif University of Technology. The course was instructed by Prof. Babak Khalaj from the Department of Electrical engineering and Prof. Mojtaba Tefagh from the Department of Mathematical Sciences.
